### Hello. I'm Khalis. 🙋‍♂️

I'm an aspiring data analyst and full-stack software engineer.

Always looking at evolving and emerging technologies, and looking at how to solve problems with the correct tools.

Also always thinking of ways to build better architectures for small-scale to large enterprise applications.
