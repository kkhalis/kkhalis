### Hello. I'm Khalis. 🙋‍♂️

Always looking at evolving and emerging technologies, and looking at how to solve problems with the correct tools.

I dabble mostly on python for data analytics. 
A bit of app/web development using various tech stacks. 
Familiar with MSSQL/MySQL for databases. 
Also always thinking of ways to build better architectures for small-scale to large enterprise applications.

Still picking up other libraries and frameworks as I go along, so I'm always open to learning new stuff.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on building better stuff with the cloud
